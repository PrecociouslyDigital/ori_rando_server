                        Open the folder where your copy of Ori DE is installed. You'll need to get back here later, so consider making a

                        </li><li>
                            GOG:  Your Ori install will be inside your GOG install at <code>...GOG Games/Ori and The Blind Forest - Definitive Edition</code> You can also right click on the game in your GOG library, click "Manage Installation" and then "Show folder".

                        From the Ori folder, navigate to oriDE_Data/Managed. Look for a file named "Assembly-CSharp.dll". To install the randomizer, we will be replacing this file, so create a
                        backup first, either by renaming it to something like Assembly-CSharp-Vanilla.dll, or moving it into a different folder.

                        <ul><li>In the Randomizer, the Grenade (light burst) skill costs no energy, which makes it a very powerful (but somewhat tricky!) method of movement when combined with Bash.</li>
                        <li>Note: Bash+Grenade movement is more difficult when using a controller. Don't worry if it takes you longer to figure out how to get around!</li>
                        <li>Note: You can't bash off of grenades that were thrown while moving, either on the ground or in the air. However, you can (usually) bash off grenades thrown while holding still with climb.</li>

                    The Ori Randomizer includes a number of gameplay changes from the base game. The most important ones are documented here.
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        The energy cost of the Grenade (light burst) skill has been removed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The energy cost of the Charge Flame skill has been reduced to 1/2; it drops to 0 after leveling Charge Flame Efficiency in the blue ability tree.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can use the Return To Start (bound to alt+R by default, rebindable using RandomizerRebindings.txt) keybinding to return to the spawn location in Sunken Glades at any time, similar to the "save and quit" functionality from the ALttP randomizer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Kuro cutscene in Hollow Grove always plays the first time you go there (In Open World, it will instead never play.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Valley killplane is always active, instead of being active as soon as you get stomp. (In Open World, it is instead never active.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        First-time pickup animations and Sein's dialog boxes are disabled, just like they would be in the base game with the UI toggled off.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition to the normal pickup locations, you can find pickups by:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Destroying petrified (blue) plants (These now show up on the minimap as exp orbs if the Map Markers ability is unlocked)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Unlocking maps by turning in mapstones (9 pickups, 1 per map)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Finishing rooms in mount horu (8 pickups, 1 per room)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are new pickups not found in the base game, including teleporter unlocks and several bonus pickups. Check out the Bonus Item Glossary guide below to learn more about them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The purple tree has been changed substantially: see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tprqq7mUJMGcgAA0TM-O5FeOklzz4dOReB0Nru3QlsI#bookmark=cax9k3:1me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a> for a full summary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The UI transparency is increased while performing a "Save Anywhere" glitch. The amount of transparency is configurable in the RandomizerSettings.txt file.
                    </li>

                        <li>
                        The blue tree is by far the most valuable use of ability points, followed by the purple tree. It is not advised to spend more than 2 or 3 points in the red tree.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        In the Clues keymode, the borders between zones are not always obvious. Check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://i.imgur.com/lHgbqmI.jpg">this map</a> to see exactly which pickup is considered to be in which zone!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Do not Alt+R out of any room with a temporary lock (Ginso miniboss 1, Grotto Miniboss, Outer Swamp Spitter puzzle area) with the door still closed. You may softlock if you do.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Do not Alt+R out of the fronkey fight after Sein unless you have already picked up the exp orb below Sein. You may softlock if you do.
                        </li>
